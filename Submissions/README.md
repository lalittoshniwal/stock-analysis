# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to refactor VBA code to make it more efficient. I measured the performance of the original and refactored codes by recording elapsed run times in excel.

## Results
The major difference in the refactored code is the use of arrays to store values and output columns in the spreadsheet.

The refactored code is more efficient as it can be executed in less time. 

### The following screenshots show the time elapsed in excel to execute the original code for years 2017 and 2018 respectively

## Summary

Advantages of refactoring a code:
 - code could be more efficient i.e. uses less computing resources, runs faster = saves time
 - well formatted and allows for coder to go back and explain logic via comments making it easier for the future readers to understand

Disadvantages of refactoring a code:
- it is time consuming and may not be needed for all codes
- it is possible to make errors and break a working code

I was able to refactor the provided code. In doing so I was able to make the code more efficient, it runs faster and perhaps it now uses less memory. As a new coder, since it is not a second nature yet, I was also able to correct indenting and add comments along the way to make it easier for future readers to understand the code. However, the process was very time consuming. In trying to make the code more efficient I made errors that took a long time to resolve. While I am hopeful that the comments will help the future reader to follow along, the code itself appears more complex.
